I tried stockings and different types of socks with the same difficulty, I just could not push my foot smoothly into the shoe.

Beck Boys Bones Wellington rain boots,"Robuste, warme Winter-Gummistiefel","Ich habe diese Gummistiefel nun das zweite Mal bestellt, aus den ersten ist mein Söhnchen herausgewachsen. Die Gummistiefel sind sehr robust: Sie haben ein ganzes Kindergartenjahr vergleichsweise gut überstanden! Sie halten warm und trocken. Es stimmt, dass die Stiefel etwas schwerer sind als andere Gummistiefel, aber meinen Sohn hat das nicht gestört oder beim Laufen behindert. Ein paar kleine Kritikpunkte: Die Blinkfunktion hat im Laufe des Jahres den Geist aufgegeben... auch riechen die Stiefel leicht nach Chemie, wenn sie noch ganz neu sind.",5,de,"I have now ordered these rubber boots for the second time, as my little son has outgrown the first ones. The rubber boots are very robust: they have comparably survived a whole year of kindergarten very well! They keep warm and dry. It is true that the boots are a bit heavier than other rubber boots, but that didn't bother my son or hinder his walking. A few minor points of criticism: The flashing function gave up during the year... also, the boots smell slightly of chemicals when they are brand new.","Sturdy, warm winter rain boots"

Beck Boys Bones Wellington rain boots,Gute Wintergummistiefel,"Mein Sohn ist sehr zufrieden. Die Stiefel sind gut verarbeitet und halten im Winter die Füsse schön trocken und warm. Sie sind von innen vollständig mit einem kuscheligen Kunstfell gefüttert und von außen im ganzen mit durchsichtigem Gummi überzogen. Das Dinosaurierskelettmuster ist schön und perfekt für alle Dinofans. Die Ferse blinkt beim gehen, was im dunklen Winter nur vom Vorteil sein kann. Der Stiefel fällt etwas groß aus. Sollte vielleicht lieber eine Größe kleiner bestellt werden. Alles im ganzen ein guter Wintergummistiefel zum relativ günstigen Preis.",5,de,"My son is very happy. The boots are well made and keep his feet nice and dry warm in the winter. They are fully lined with a cozy artificial fur inside and completely covered with transparent rubber on the outside.

"ASICS Men's EVORIDE 2 Running Shoe, French Blue Hazard Green, 7 UK",足裏へのダメージの少ないシューズ,１８キロほどを３回走りましたが、クッション性がよくて足裏の疲労度はさほどでもありませんでした。他の軽量の靴と比べると足へのダメージが少ない気がします。微妙な重さ（２６ｃｍで２２０グラムくらい）なので、もっと軽い靴が欲しい人にはホカオネオネのＲＩＮＣＯＮ３の方がいいかもしれません。ソールの踵に近い部分は３回目で少々ささくれ立っています。耐久性は期待しないほうがいいかも。親指にやんわりと「前に行け」という指令が入るようになっているので走りやすい靴ではあります。,4,ja,"I ran about 18 kilometers three times, but the cushioning was good and the fatigue level of the soles of my feet was not too high. Compared to other lightweight shoes, I feel that there is less damage to the feet. The weight is subtle (about 220 grams at 26 cm), so for those who want lighter shoes, Hoka One One's RINCON3 might be better. The area near the heel of the sole is slightly rough after the third use. It might be better not to expect durability. It is an easy-to-run shoe because there is a gentle instruction to 'go forward' on the big toe.",Shoes with little damage to the soles
