"ASICS Women's 1012A699-003_42 Running Shoes, Black, 7.5 UK",厚底は慣れるまでは慎重に。,厚底とアーチが足を前に出す機能をゆっくり走る時に強く効果を感じますね。ただ初の厚底だったので、走る環境も考えて走らないといけないと思います。いつも通りに走ってしまうと着地不安定となり転倒してしまうかもしれません。転倒して顔面強打、頬骨ヒビ入りましたので、慎重に徐々に慣らしていきましょう。,5,"Thick soles and arches provide a function that slowly brings the feet forward when running, which can be strongly felt. However, because it was my first time trying thick soles, I believe that I need to consider the running environment and run carefully. If I run as usual, I might experience unstable landings and fall. I fell and hit my face, resulting in a cracked cheekbone, so let's carefully and gradually acclimatize to running with caution.",Wear thick-soled shoes carefully until you get used to them.

Beck Boys Bones Wellington rain boots,Sehr gute Winterstiefel!,Mein 4- jähriger Sohn liebt diese Stiefel und möchte seine anderen Schuhe nicht mehr tragen. Er hat in den Stiefeln keine Schweißfüße wie in einigen anderen Schuhen. Er läuft sehr gut  darin und hat auch bei eisigen Temperaturen keine kalten Füße. Die Stiefel sind meiner Meinung nach von einer sehr guten Qualität und deshalb etwas schwerer. Meinen Sohn stört das überhaupt nicht. Er kommt perfekt rein und wieder raus (das war bei anderen Stiefeln problematischer). Das Highlight für ihn ist natürlich das blinken. Ich werde die Stiefel auch wohl im nächsten Winter kaufen.,5,"My 4-year-old son loves these boots and doesn't want to wear his other shoes anymore. He doesn't get sweaty feet in these boots like in some other shoes. He walks very well in them and doesn't have cold feet even in icy temperatures. In my opinion, the boots are of very good quality and therefore a bit heavier. My son doesn't mind at all. He gets in and out perfectly (which was more problematic with other boots). Of course, the highlight for him is the flashing lights. I will probably buy the boots again next winter.",Very good winter boots!
Beck Boys Bones Wellington rain boots,Perfekt auch für etwas breitere Kinderfüße,"Beck Gummistiefel begleiten uns nun schon einige Jahre. Passform super, vorallem, wenn die Füße etwas breiter geschnitten sind. Klare Kaufempfehlung. Die Leuchtfunktion beim Gehen ein Highlight für die Kleinen. Schuhe halten die Füße im Herbst und Winter schön warm. Wir haben dieses Modell schon das zweite Jahr im Einsatz.",5,"Beck rubber boots have been accompanying us for several years now. Great fit, especially when the feet are a bit wider. Clear purchase recommendation. The light function while walking is a highlight for the little ones. Shoes keep the feet nice and warm in autumn and winter. We have been using this model for the second year already.",Perfect also for slightly wider children's feet
Beck Boys Bones Wellington rain boots,Super Gummistiefel,"Habe die Gummistiefel für meine beiden Kinder gekauft. Und sie wurden ausgiebig im Urlaub, am Strand und in Pfützen, getestet.

Beck Boys Bones Wellington rain boots,"Robuste, warme Winter-Gummistiefel","Ich habe diese Gummistiefel nun das zweite Mal bestellt, aus den ersten ist mein Söhnchen herausgewachsen. Die Gummistiefel sind sehr robust: Sie haben ein ganzes Kindergartenjahr vergleichsweise gut überstanden! Sie halten warm und trocken. Es stimmt, dass die Stiefel etwas schwerer sind als andere Gummistiefel, aber meinen Sohn hat das nicht gestört oder beim Laufen behindert. Ein paar kleine Kritikpunkte: Die Blinkfunktion hat im Laufe des Jahres den Geist aufgegeben... auch riechen die Stiefel leicht nach Chemie, wenn sie noch ganz neu sind.",5,"I have now ordered these rubber boots for the second time, my little son has outgrown the first ones. The rubber boots are very robust: they have survived a whole year in kindergarten comparatively well! They keep warm and dry. It is true that the boots are a bit heavier than other rubber boots, but that did not bother my son or hinder him while walking. A few small points of criticism: The light-up function has given up over the course of the year... also, the boots smell slightly of chemicals when they are brand new.","Sturdy, warm winter rubber boots"
Beck Boys Bones Wellington rain boots,Schöner Jungen Stiefel,Die Gummistiefel sind sehr schön verarbeitet und unser Sohn liebt sie.

Sie sind von innen vollständig mit einem kuscheligen Kunstfell gefüttert und von außen im ganzen mit durchsichtigem Gummi überzogen. Das Dinosaurierskelettmuster ist schön und perfekt für alle Dinofans. Die Ferse blinkt beim gehen, was im dunklen Winter nur vom Vorteil sein kann. Der Stiefel fällt etwas groß aus. Sollte vielleicht lieber eine Größe kleiner bestellt werden. Alles im ganzen ein guter Wintergummistiefel zum relativ günstigen Preis.",5,"My son is very happy. The boots are well made and keep his feet nice and dry and warm in the winter. They are fully lined with a cozy faux fur on the inside and covered all around with transparent rubber on the outside. The dinosaur skeleton pattern is nice and perfect for all Dino fans. The heel blinks when walking, which can only be advantageous in the dark winter. The boot runs a bit large. You may want to consider ordering a size smaller. All in all, a good winter rubber boot at a relatively cheap price.",Good winter rubber boots

Unfortunately, the first ones did not fit, so we ordered them again in a larger size. He is now very satisfied, they blink, keep dry, and are also a bit fluffy on the inside, making them warmer than other boots.",Great for Dino fans
