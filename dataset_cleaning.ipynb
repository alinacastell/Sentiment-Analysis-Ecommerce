I am very happy with them. \n",

      "review translation:  Due to my 22cm feet, there are few brands that offer this size. The design is cute and satisfying, but the comfort is disappointing. It seems like they use parts from larger sizes for small sizes. The tongue is too long, causing rubs and scratches on the ankles, especially when bent (not suitable for sneaker socks). The distance from the heel to the arch of the insole is too long, making the arch hit the toes, causing a feeling of weight on the heels.

The only issue is the blue insole - my feet perspire and the blue colour runs into my socks.  Also, the round laces look nice but they do not remain tied; they need a knot in the bow to maintain the tie.  They are very attractive shoes and do not look huge in size 12. Thank you. CHL. \n",

I had bought a pair of RAVON shoes over two years ago at an expensive shoe store and I did not regret spending the money because they were perfect walking shoes and they gave me plenty of support. I have a bunion on my left big toe and I had plenty of room for that foot. The new ones are just as comfortable as my old pair and they keep me balanced. By the way, my original pair that is 2 1/2 years old is still good, but I am using them to \n",

My partial orthotic fit well into the heel of the shoe. The shoe not only has aqua-colored accents (shoe string eyelets) but also has an aqua liner throughout the shoe. As I was slipping my socked foot into the shoe for the first time, that inner liner sort of bunched up and made the shoe top look distorted. As if the liner pushed forward and down causing the upper portion and \n",

      "review translation:  I like the style and weight of this shoe, just right for wearing all day. Good quality components. However, as other reviewers have said, the insole makes wearing these shoes impossible. The surface of the insoles is some attractive suede fabric which looks like it will be very comfortable. In fact, the fabric prevents your foot from sliding into the shoe. I forced my feet in and my toes were uncomfortably turned in on themselves, I could not possibly wear these shoes like that. I tried stockings and different types of socks with the same difficulty, I just could not push my foot smoothly into the shoe. Then \n",

This is pretty close. It works well with chinos or colored denim. They would not look right with \"dress\" pants, but for business casual, it's good. I'm always between 8 and 8.5. I went with an 8 and they fit perfectly.  I also need good support and these are reasonable. I have another pair of Aravon shoes (mary jane) and they also work well. \n",

I am still happy with the shoes cuz they are super cute. Besides the stiff tongue my only other complaint is they seem a tad larger than my other size tens. I have a little more space than I like to have. Otherwise completely awesome! \n",

When I tried them on, they were really stiff and a bit tight. Who knows maybe they would stretch out as I wore them, but they just didn't fit. I am disappointed that I can't find the size I need anywhere, but will keep looking. \n",

Other reviews said it ran small, but I didn't find that the case. I bought the 10D width. The wider width doesn't look odd, it fits the shoe well and my foot. \n",

I originally bought them when my family was going to visit The Ark in Kentucky and knew we would be doing a lot of walking. There has never been a time when my feet hurt while wearing these shoes. I often receive compliments on how cute they look. So, these are the best shoes for me in terms of comfort and style! I bought them again to update and also bought an additional pair in black. \n",

Immediately took off the shoes and checked what was going on. There was a really big bend in the inner sole of the toddler shoe that couldn't be straightened out. Regrettable, especially since the shoe itself is not in the discount sector. I would have expected more. \n",

Compared to other lightweight shoes, I feel that there is less damage to my feet.
